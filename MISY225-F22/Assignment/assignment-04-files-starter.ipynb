    "## File Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are required to parse a text file (unstructured data) into a json file (structured data). This is an example of a common data processing task often needed for data science projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is designed to be like a real project without much instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input file is `songs.txt`, which you need to analyze (this is the key - you need to understand how the data is structured) and generate a json file as shown in `songs.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge you need may include but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- read and write files\n",
    "- regular expression\n",
    "- string manipulation\n",
    "- list and dict manipulation\n",
    "- various control structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is no standard solution - as long as you get the required output file.\n",
    "2. You cannot hardcode anything - for example, you cannot use a specific number in the list or a line number in the file to access data. Points will be taken off if any hardcoding is found in your solution."
